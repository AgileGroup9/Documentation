# Individual reflection w2 - David Bejmer

I want to learn more specifically which areas of knowledge we need to delve deeper into for our particular idea making an online ordering system.
In the beginning I can hopefully help my team to structure the planning process.
I haven't used Scrum before, but I'm keen on keeping things structured and also interested in how Scrum can help with this.
My contribution towards deliverables is probably mostly to push for meetings and decisions.

I'm happy that we have decided the project scope. We haven't done much more work with github, but are planning to learn it in the coming weeks.
