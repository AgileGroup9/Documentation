Have spent most of the week communicating with our client about specifiks of the project.
The client seems happy sofar so not mutch to improve right now.

Many in the group have little experience with git and github workflow. To remedy this i will try to find resources and
maybe plan a crashcourse over zoom/discord.

The first step of this project is to determine a good UI. However i remember very litle from my last course about it.
to solve that i will re-read som chapers from the course
