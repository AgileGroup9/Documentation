# Individual Reflections week 2

* I want to learn more about our project.
* I can answer other group members questions.
* We didn't do much in any scrum sense this week, so I didn't get a chance to
  contribute anything towards out use of scrum.
* I came up with a question to ask our external stakeholder.
