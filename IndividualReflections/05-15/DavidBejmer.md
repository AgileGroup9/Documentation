what do I want to learn or understand better?
I'm still not totally comfortable with git so I'd like to improve with that. I'd also like to improve my strategic thinking(planning etc) with projects like these.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I hope that I can help my team with things regarding finding what's value-adding for the customer.

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
This sprint I have helped with the overall planning and structuring of the sprint.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have helped with the feature about being able to customize the menu on the admin-page, given feedback to pull-requests etc. I haven't hade as much tasks as I could have done, so next week I plan to take on a bit more.
