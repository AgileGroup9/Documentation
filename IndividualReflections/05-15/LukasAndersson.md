## Individual Reflection 05-15

This week I have been pentesting the product trying to find bugs and weird behaviours, I have found several relatively important bugs to fix which is always great. There is always bugs left in all programs however so theres probably plenty more to find. It was important to get this done this week since we will show the product to our customer next week.
