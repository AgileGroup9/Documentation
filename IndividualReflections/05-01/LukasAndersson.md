## Individual Reflection 05-01

I started this week on the wrong path, thinking I could solve the problem in a certain way which ended up not being possible. Even though that means I did not do very much personal progress that also means that I leared things I otherwise would not know about with wordpress, which makes my understanding for wordpress deeper. In other words this week was more learning than progress for me personally.
