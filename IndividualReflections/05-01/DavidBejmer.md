We're now in the end of the third sprint and I feel I've gotten better at my git-workflow, which was the goal I set for myself last week. 
I've still a lot to learn with git so my goal for the next sprint is to keep improving that. My contributions this week has primarily been to simplify our thinking (and code) around the product, to get a smaller MVP, and therefore getting to it quicker.
I've also created my firt git-branch and worked in that.
