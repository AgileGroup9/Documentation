# Individual Reflections week 4 <small>Mårten Åsberg</small>

* I don't know all of the stuff I might need to. Therefore I want to learn more
  about that.
* Not everyone in my team knows how to use git and Node.JS, but I do. More
  people need to know how to use git better and what Node.JS is. I can answer 
  questions from my group members on how to use git and about Node.JS.
* I've precipitated in our scrum meetings and followed the set up structure for
  them. I was a proponent for our team switching from GitHub Project to Trello
  for our scrum board.
* I have "translated" Joakim's UI code to fit in as a WordPress plugin.
  Hopefully it will soon be accepted in code review.
