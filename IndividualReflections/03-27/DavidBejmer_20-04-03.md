# Individual reflection w2 - David Bejmer

I want to learn more specifically which areas of knowledge we need to delve deeper into to for our particular idea.
In the beginning I can hopefully help my team to structure the planning process.
I haven't used Scrum before, but I'm keen on using Scrum during this project.
My contribution towards deliverables is probably mostly to push for meetings and decisions.

I'm happy that we have decided the project scope. We haven't done much more work with github, but are planning to learn it in the coming weeks.
