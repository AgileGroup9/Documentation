As a team we have created a social contract, choosen communication channels, and gatherd potential projects from external potential customers.
Since we have not choosen a project to run yet, I have started learning the alternatives that exist for gui development i python.
This seems like a good choice since whatever direction we go we will need a gui and there is python experience in the group.
