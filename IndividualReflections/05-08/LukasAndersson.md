## Individual Reflection 05-08

After last weeks mistakes I started this week on the right path, which made the task much easier. The solution ended up being way easier to implement compared to what I first thought. This week I've learnt a lot and made some progress which is nice. We also had very good communication which let me ask group members for help when something was weird.
