what do I want to learn or understand better?
- I wan't to learn more about integration of the payment system swish and how we can send email in a reliable way. 

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- I have good knowledge in the db-system and can probably help the group with queries and such. 

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
- I pitch for continuous use of trello as scrum-board and keep communications about certain tasks in their specific posts. We try to do it as Scrum-like as possible while still keeping our efficiency high.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
- I've helped with the task concerning the Admin-page to visualize orders etc. I got stuck with my subtask and would have wanted to help more with the task. 
Maybe I should have asked my team earlier before searching for many hours for a solution.
