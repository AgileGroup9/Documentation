# Individual Reflections week 5 <small>Mårten Åsberg</small>

* To find other ways than emails to notify the pizza bakers, want to learn more
  about [Push API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API),
  because I think that could be a good alternative.
* I can help my teammates with coding and git issues.
* I've continued to use Trello as our scrum board.
* I have created a payment confirmation pane that tells the user to pay with
  Swish, and I've helped my teammates with some merge conflicts.
