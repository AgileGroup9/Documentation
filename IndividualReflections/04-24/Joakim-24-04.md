I wan't to be more profficant with modern webdevelopment like react and modern css. The problem is that it's a constantly
developing field that has many options to choose from. To become better i have decided to experiment on the weekend with modern tools, and then decide wether or not to incorporate them into our project.

We use git and github to work together on the code for the projekt. Hovewer since git is so powerfull we have to make sure that we follow proper procedure when we work to make sure everything is maintainable.

There are many rules and guidelines that are not apparent to new users which have lead to some of our 'greener' teammembers
making many mistakes when submiting pr to github. This leads to confusion among teammembers and nullify the advantages of git.

To solve this the more senior members of the group (me) will work more clossly with the other members in the begining to make sure the projekt is maintainable in the future.

One of the goals with scrum is to quickly iterate versions of the project. For this to work we need good communication. Hovewere during the week there was som misscommunication that lead to wasted time. To solve this I have advocated an extra meeting during the week to keep everyone up to date on eachother work.

For the user to send the delivery order to our customer we need to establish a protocol. To accomplish this i worked with some other teammembers to create a communication specification. I then uppdated our customer facing form to package the user supplied info into JSON objects that are sent via an HTTP POST request to the server.

I think we achived our sprint goal this week. We predicted correctly that there would be alot of problems as the group got used to working togheter and with new technology so we didn't set our sprint goal as ambitious as what we hope we can accomplish later in the project.
