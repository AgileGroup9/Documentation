# Individual Reflections week 3

* I still want to learn more about WordPress plugins and React.
* I can continue to help my groupmates with git/GitHub and review their code.
* I still follow Joakim's meeting plans.
* I have created a basic layout for our WordPress plugin, set up an example for
  communication between our front-end and our back-end, I've set up Travis CI to
  check any new commits for syntax errors in PHP, and I've solved some issues on
  our UI.  
  Basically, I've been doing a lot of coding but maybe not as much planing and
  "scrumming".
